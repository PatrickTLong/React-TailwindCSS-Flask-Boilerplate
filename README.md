Welcome!

I've created a starter template using Flask, React, and Tailwind, preconfigured and ready to go. Here's how to get started:

Frontend:

Open a terminal and run npm install to set up Vite.
Add new components to the components folder and import them into App.jsx for rendering.

Backend:

Set up a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

Activate the environment and install dependencies:
pip install SQLAlchemy python-dotenv flask-migrate Flask flask-cors psycopg2-binary

You're all set to start building! ðŸš€
