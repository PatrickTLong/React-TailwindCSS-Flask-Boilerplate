Hello! So i created a little starting template with Flask, React, and Tailwind preprepared with all of the config and everything up running. All that should be needed for frontend is to run
npm install so that vite can be enabled, then you are 
free to add more components to the components folder and to start working! Send the components to App.jsx and that should render it. 
For the backend a virtual enviroment should be installed by running python -m venv venv, and activating it then when inside the venv run pip install SQlAlchemy, python-dotenv, flask-migrate, Flask, flask-cors to 
install all the necessary details. 

Steps: 

Frontend: 
1.Go into Terminal and install npm 

Backend: 
1.Install vitual enviroment 
2.Then enter virtual enviroment and run - pip install SQlAlchemy, python-dotenv, flask-migrate, Flask, flask-cors 

All Set!
